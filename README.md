# LJGL

This repository hosts my common OpenGL code for easy reuse in multiple projects.
This is certainly not even close to being a complete and usable OpenGL library, I add features as I need them.

## Adding to CMake project
Simply `add_subdirectory(LJGL)`. See https://github.com/LJ3D/LJGL-EXAMPLE for a (reasonably) basic example
